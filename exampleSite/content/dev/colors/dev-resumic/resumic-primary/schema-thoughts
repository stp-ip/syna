ToDo:
* legal section updates
* legal.identifier instead of idNumber
* use item example twice

Ideas:
Use bibtex or bibjson for publications? or add bibtex field 14

group skills by area?

filter + tags 10

localization 80/81

relax schema with more optional fields etc. 119

theme ToDo:
* personal
* publications
* legal
* color optimization especially around primary
* check text-color usage all necessary?
* icon text-color usage correct?
* migrate arnells resume and test design -> get feedback
* location: mapbox api key where to configure? global? proxy service? -->
* location: config for accuracy? country-region-city, country-city, city, region-city -->
* fall through image support
* base64 encoding images gotten from url (https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/5686)
* syna resumic example using okkur projects etc. testing edge cases etc. and being checked by cypress (after all is done)
* sort sections in resumic.html
* default localized version to english in code
* downloadable version aka downloadable config + code to download data as well as (PDF)
* <hr> for per section summary

* setting to use labels instead of progress bars?
* summary per skill?

* conformance test aka is all data possibly showing up - could be used later on to show users what fields each theme supports

Iteration thoughts:
* additional level for summary
* section summary to have more flexibility for users to explain anomalies good or bad
* numeric enums to remove the association and make sorting etc. easier for devs - levels now need to be documented
* disposition data to help with making matches easier to find
*
