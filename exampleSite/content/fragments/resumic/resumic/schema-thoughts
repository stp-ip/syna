Ideas:
Use bibtex or bibjson for publications? or add bibtex field 14
filter + tags 10

localization 80/81

relax schema with more optional fields etc. 119

theme ToDo :
* legal
    roles
    description
    applicationDate
    legalType
    identifier
    currentAssignee
    previousAssignee
    coAuthors
* awards
    description
* certificates
    description
* publications
    full
    http://okfnlabs.org/bibjson/ ?
* sort sections in resumic.html
* location: mapbox api key where to configure? global? proxy service? -->
* migrate arnells resume and test design -> get feedback

theme
* default localized version to english in code?
* localization for DE
* color optimization especially around primary
* check text-color usage all necessary?
* icon text-color usage correct?
* location: config for accuracy? country-region-city, country-city, city, region-city -->
* fall through image support
* base64 encoding images gotten from url (https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/5686)
* syna resumic example using okkur projects etc. testing edge cases etc. and being checked by cypress (after all is done)
* downloadable version aka downloadable config + code to download data as well as (PDF) - remove personal (if not shown) and obfuscate location data?
* screen reader additions for icons
* conformance test aka is all data possibly showing up - could be used later on to show users what fields each theme supports
* print breaks avaoid inside resume-item
* print should not be mobile view

Iteration thoughts:
* additional level for summary
* section summary to have more flexibility for users to explain anomalies good or bad
* numeric enums to remove the association and make sorting etc. easier for devs - levels now need to be documented
* disposition data to help with making matches easier to find
* Use go template comments with html comments as well -> {{- /*<!-- Whitelisted network names to be used for icons -->*/ -}} TODO: create issue to fix overall comments in Syna
* use roles instead of positions to make it more standard between all sections
